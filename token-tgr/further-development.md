TGR tokens are a payment custom token on The Open Network (TON) blockchain. Tokens will be credited to users for stacking Tegro's partner NFT collections. Each collection has its own unique set of rules and conditions, so TGR accrual may vary depending on the selected collection.

In addition, it will be possible to farming and staking token on DEX. This will allow users to get a good percentage of profit and reduce the risks of investing in the project.

Also, as previously announced, in the near future, users will be able to receive TGR tokens as a cashback for the exchanges carried out on the exchange. This will allow users to receive additional bonuses by using Tegro.Finance to trade cryptocurrencies and exchange tokens on the TON blockchain.
