## What is token burn?

Token burning is a process that permanently removes tokens from circulation, thereby reducing the total supply. This can be done in several ways, but most often by sending tokens to a "dead" address. Token burning is usually done by the development team behind the cryptocurrency asset. Its current balance is displayed in the blockchain, but no one has access to its contents.

## Why is it important to burn tokens?

There are several benefits from the token-burning procedure:

* **Increase in token value**

Burning reduces token turnover, thus decreasing the total supply. This can potentially increase the value of a token. Constant token burning helps maintain a stable value.

* **Stable token value**

Constant token burning helps maintain a stable value for the crypto-asset, and it also makes a bet on long-term price appreciation. Burning tokens can make the holder's token more valuable than it was before it was burned.
