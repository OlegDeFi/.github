* Browser Extension

One of the priorities for the development of Tegro Wallet is to develop an extension for the browser (MetaMask on TON). With support for all functions that are already available in web version. Extension will be available for the following browsers:

1. Brave&#x20;
2. Mozzila Firefox&#x20;

* SDK for developers.&#x20;
* Version for IOS and Android.&#x20;
* Authorizations via TON Auth.&#x20;
* Built-in DEX (token-swap)

Our wallet will get tight integration with the decentralized exchange, which will allow users to exchange tokens in the TON network between themselves, in the most convenient way.

* Ability to connect a hardware wallet.&#x20;
