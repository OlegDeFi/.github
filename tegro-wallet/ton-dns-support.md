# âœ… TON DNS support

Tegro Wallet offers its users the TON DNS functionality, which allows them to easily and quickly send TGR tokens and other tokens running in the TON network to addresses with ".ton" domains.

With this feature, users can send tokens in just one click, without having to copy and paste long wallet addresses.

One of the main advantages of TON DNS is its ease of use, which is especially important for newcomers who do not have much experience with cryptocurrencies and do not want to risk their funds.

Moreover, the functionality of TON DNS allows the user to manage their funds in Tegro Wallet more efficiently and conveniently.

Names of the ".ton" type are NFT-tokens and are stored on the wallet's balance. This means they can be forwarded and posted for sale on NFT-marketplaces.
