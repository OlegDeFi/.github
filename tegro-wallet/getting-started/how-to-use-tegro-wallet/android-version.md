description: How to use the Wallet on Android devices
---

# Android version

{% hint style="success" %}
To start using a cryptocurrency wallet on the TON blockchain, you need to go to the Google Play app store and [download Tegro Wallet](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tonholdwallet.android).
{% endhint %}

Once you've finished downloading and installing the app, you can start using the wallet.

For new users, Tegro Wallet offers the creation of a new wallet in which you can store TON coins and other tokens on TON, as well as use the TON DNS functionality.

If you already have a cryptocurrency wallet on the TON blockchain, you can import it into the Tegro Wallet app and continue working with your assets without any restrictions.
