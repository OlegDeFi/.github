# Browser Extension

The Tegro Wallet browser extension is one of the priorities in the development of our app.

It will have all the same features already available in the web version of Tegro Wallet, with the same user-friendly interface and quick access to your wallet on TON.

{% hint style="info" %}
The Tegro Wallet extension will be available for several popular browsers, including [Google Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/uniton-ton-toncoin-wallet/cdpdjfhimjdmbakdbabcklagceoikifg), Brave, Mozilla Firefox and [Edge](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/ton-hold-%E2%80%94-toncoin-wallet/dgegbhgbijbhkmkacomdlogdkacokpam).
{% endhint %}

Users will be able to easily install the extension on their browser and use all the features of Tegro Wallet without having to open a separate web page.

We are confident that this will be a convenient and easy way to manage your wallet on TON, and we look forward to the release of this extension in the near future.
