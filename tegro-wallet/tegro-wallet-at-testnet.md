# ðŸ”§ Tegro Wallet at Testnet

If you are a developer on The Open Network (TON) blockchain, using the TON test network can be very useful for developing and testing your applications.

{% hint style="info" %}
You can get free test coins, which should not be confused with real TON coins, by using the bot testgiver\_ton\_bot.
{% endhint %}

The TON test network recreates almost the entire infrastructure of the main network, allowing developers to test their applications in conditions as close to reality as possible. The wallets, APIs, bridges, and other tools of the test network can be found on the [corresponding page](https://ton.org/docs/#/testnet/).

To make it easy to use the TON test network, Tegro Wallet provides a version of its wallet running on the test network, available at [https://dev.uniton.app](https://dev.uniton.app/). Using this wallet, you can receive, send, and transfer test TON coins to test your applications.
