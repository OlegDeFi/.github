# ðŸ”§ DEX on Testnet

To ensure user convenience and security, the TON test network has recreated almost the entire infrastructure of the core network, including wallets, APIs, bridges, and other necessary tools.

All of these tools are available on the [corresponding page](https://ton.org/docs/#/testnet/), allowing users to test and experiment with the platform's various functionalities in a secure environment.

Tegro Wallet also supports a test network, allowing users to conveniently receive, transfer and send test TON coins.

In addition, free test coins can be obtained using the @testgiver\_ton\_bot bot.

For testing and authorization in DEX, it is recommended to use [TON Wallet Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ton-wallet/nphplpgoakhhjchkkhmiggakijnkhfnd).

It provides convenient and secure access to DEX functionality, allows you to conduct transactions with coins in the test network and authorize in the system safely and quickly.
