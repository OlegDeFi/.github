### Token&#x20;

A token is a digital asset that can be created based on blockchain technology and is a unit of value that can be exchanged and stored digitally.

The price of a token can be determined by market supply and demand, which can cause it to go up or down.

Tokens can be used for a variety of purposes, such as participating in ICOs, voting on platforms, buying goods and services, exchanging for other assets, etc.

In the context of DEX, tokens can be exchanged for each other in liquidity pools, providing users with access to a wide range of cryptocurrency pairs and allowing them to conduct transactions without having to go through centralized exchanges.

### Liquidity pool

A liquidity pool consists of two tokens that are added in equal shares or proportions by liquidity providers.

This creates a market for trading these tokens and also provides liquidity for users who want to exchange one token for another.

Each liquidity provider receives an LP token, which confirms their ownership of a share in the pool. These tokens can then be used to withdraw funds from the liquidity pool.

### Swap&#x20;

Swap is an exchange transaction that takes place on decentralized exchanges (DEX) such as Tegro.Finance.

In a Swap transaction, the user sends one token and receives another token in return at the current market price.

The exchange is instantaneous through the use of blockchain-based smart contracts. Swap transactions are the primary way to trade on decentralized exchanges.

### Volume

Volume in the context of trading refers to the total number of trades made in the market over a certain period of time, expressed in U.S. dollars or other currencies.

Trading volume is one of the most important indicators of market activity and is often used to assess its liquidity.

### Pair

A pair usually means two tokens that form a liquidity pool on a decentralized exchange.

For example, on Tegro.Finance, pairs can be TGR/TON, FNZ/TON and others. Each pair has its own unique contract address, which can be used to create orders to buy or sell tokens in that pair.

### Slippage tolerance

Slippage tolerance allows you to set the maximum difference between the expected price of a token and its price at the time of the transaction.

This parameter is used to protect against large price changes that may occur between the time a transaction is sent and its execution on the blockchain.

If the token price changes by more than the set allowable slippage, the transaction will not be executed to protect the user from losing money.

### TVL

TVL (Total Value Locked) is a metric that reflects the total value of cryptocurrencies locked into a particular protocol or liquidity pool.

This metric is an important indicator for measuring the attractiveness and popularity of certain decentralized financial protocols (DeFi) because it shows how much money users are willing to lock into that protocol to generate revenue or to participate in voting to manage the protocol.

### Explorer

Explorer is a graphical user interface developed by users to analyze The Open Network's blockchain.

Using the Explorer, the user can view information about blocks that have been added to the blockchain, transactions and messages that have taken place, account balances and token information.
