# DEX on CoinMarketCap

Our DEX was added to CoinMarketCap service, one of the most popular resources for tracking cryptocurrency prices and cryptocurrency projects. This is an important step for our project, which will allow more people to learn about our exchange and tokens on TON.

However, at the moment, trading on DEX is not yet tracked, as the exchange has only passed initial moderation. After CoinMarketCap checks our API, and as soon as all checks are completed, the exchange and tokens that have fulfilled the conditions of the placement will be added to the service.

The conditions to be met by token projects for placement on CoinMarketCap are as follows:

* TVL pairs worth the equivalent of $5,000;
* Daily trading volume of at least $1,000.
