## How to Make Money from Liquidity Pools <a href="#how-to-make-money-from-liquidity-pools" id="how-to-make-money-from-liquidity-pools"></a>

A liquidity pool is a "reservoir" of cryptocurrencies in pairs. A user who buys for TON, for example, TGR, is given TGR tokens from a liquidity pair, and his TON coins are sent to the pool in return.&#x20;

Liquidity providers are people who provide liquidity to pools, for which they receive a percentage of the commissions spent on exchanges in a particular pair. The interest is credited in the cryptocurrencies of the trading pair, in our case - TGR and TON.&#x20;

To become a liquidity provider, you need to create an LP-pair (liquidity pair) at DEX [Tegro.Finance](http://www.tegro.finance/) in a 50%/50% ratio, for example, TGR-TON pair.&#x20;

After that, you will be sent a liquidity token to your TON-wallet, which is a confirmation that you are a liquidity provider. This token can be exchanged back into your cryptocurrency at any time.&#x20;

### **What are Impermanent Losses**&#x20;

Impermanent Loss can occur because of volatility and change in the value of one cryptocurrency in relation to the value at which it was bought.&#x20;

Example: if TON coin rate goes up by 50%, then in LP-pair the cryptocurrency TGR will decrease by 50%.&#x20;

Pay attention to token rates, sometimes it is more profitable to keep cryptocurrency rather than add it to the liquidity pool.&#x20;
