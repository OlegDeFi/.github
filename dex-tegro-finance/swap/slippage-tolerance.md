# Slippage tolerance

The allowable slippage is the difference between the expected price of a token and its price at the time of the transaction.

This parameter can be changed by setting the maximum slippage when making an exchange, which allows controlling risks when trading on the cryptocurrency market.

If the allowable slippage is set, the exchange will monitor token price changes when making a transaction and will not allow the transaction to be completed if the price changes by more than the specified percentage.

Thus, the allowable slippage helps protect the investor from large losses in the event of a sharp change in the price of the token.

However, it is worth keeping in mind that setting too much slippage may result in missing out on a profitable transaction, so this setting should be tailored to the investor's individual needs and strategy.
