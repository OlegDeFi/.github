[Tegro Finance](https://tegro.finance/) is a decentralized exchange platform that allows users to exchange tokens for TON.

DEX (decentralized exchange) allows users to trade tokens directly among themselves, without intermediaries or centralized exchanges. This offers advantages such as increased security and anonymity.

Commissions at Tegro Finance are very low - only 0.4%, which can make the cryptocurrency exchange attractive for those who want to trade tokens with minimal costs. A multi-type referral program also attracts new users to the exchange.
