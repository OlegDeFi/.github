## User Agreement/Offer

**A user agreement/offer** is a contract between the user and the owner. The contract must contain the subject of the agreement, what obligations the store has to the user, and what the user agrees to when registering or paying for it. Also the term of validity can be added to the user agreement/offer.

The document regulates the relationship between the user and the site, based on this document the rights and responsibilities of each party should be specified. For example, what the user can do, the powers of the administration, what violations can result in a block, etc.

{% hint style="warning" %}
It is recommended to describe the responsibilities of the parties on sites where registration is required before purchase.
