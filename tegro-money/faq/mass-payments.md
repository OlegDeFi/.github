# Mass Payments

To do this, you need to have an active project with a final category and an account that has been authenticated.

## How do I connect mass payments as an individual?

To manager@tegro.money from your registration mailbox you need to send a justification for connecting mass payouts:

1. Rationale for the need for mass payout functionality/business model for your site.
2. What place do account holders have in your business process to which funds will be withdrawn?
3. What will the owners of the props receive these funds for?
4. How often do you intend to use mass payouts?
5. How much of the total payout will mass payouts approximately take up?

Next, you will be contacted by a responsible employee to let you know the result or to ask additional questions, if any. The answer will be duplicated in the chat or ticket system.

## How do I connect mass payments as a legal entity partner?

Unfortunately, the mass payout functionality is not available for legal entity partners.
